#Image Classification using Deep Learning on CIFAR-10
This project focuses on building a deep learning model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 color images in 10 classes such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more. The goal is to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Python and TensorFlow/Keras that can accurately categorize these images into their respective classes.

The project will include:

Data preprocessing and augmentation to handle the small size of images.
Building, training, and evaluating a CNN model.
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
Visualization of the training process and model predictions.
